# RTDS

RTDS stands for "Radio Tagging Data Schema". It's a standard JSON object that have to be provided by radios stations to applications like radio players. RTDS aims to standardize the way that tags are formated while streaming softwares like Shoutcast or Icecast still expose just a string containing the artist and the title.

# Implementations

For now, only a PHP version of RTDS is implemented.

TODO :

* NodeJS version

Feel free to do some pull requests for other langages versions (Ruby, C, C++, Python, â€¦)
